**NHANES Clustering Analysis Using K-Means and DBSCAN**

This project compares K-Means and DBSCAN on the NHANES dataset to identify clusters and outliers.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is used to reduce data complexity while preserving key patterns.

K-Means Clustering: Assigns data points to a fixed number of clusters based on centroids.

DBSCAN Clustering: Groups points based on density, allowing for better outlier detection.

**Key Findings**

K-Means identified 3 clusters but didnâ€™t align well visually.

DBSCAN detected 2 main clusters and outliers more accurately.
